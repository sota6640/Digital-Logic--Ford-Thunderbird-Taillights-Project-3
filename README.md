# Digital-Logic--Ford-Thunderbird-Taillights-Project-3

For this project, we are designing finite state machines which will simulate tail lights of a 1965 Ford Thunderbird. The state machines will be operated through the KEY[1:0] and the SW[9:0] from our DE-10 board. There will be a total of six states, for which each state results in a certain behavior of the taillights. We’ll be viewing the taillights and the finite states work through the uses of our HEX[0] display and the ten LED[9:0]. The six states are going to be manually operated. There is also another section of this project where we automate the individual states, not requiring us to manipulate the KEYs and switches. The taillights will be automated through a memory block which we’re going to make in Quartus Prime.
